# Minimalistic Neovim

Hi! This is a minimalistic Neovim config that could be your starting point.
This config is inspired by [TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries) and his [Kickstart Config](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
Honestly, [Kickstart Config](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) is likely a better starting option because it's better documented.

Features:
    - Minimalistic (check included plugins below)
    - Only about 300 lines
